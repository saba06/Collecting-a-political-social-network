# Collecting a political social network<br />



In this assignment, I've given you a list of Twitter accounts of 4

U.S. presedential candidates.<br />



The goal is to use the Twitter API to construct a social network of these<br />

accounts. We will then use the [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) library<br />

to plot these links, as well as print some statistics of the resulting graph.
