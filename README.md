# Collecting-a-political-social-network
In this assignment, I've given you a list of Twitter accounts of 15 U.S. presedential candidates.<br />
The goal is to use the Twitter API to construct a social network of these accounts. We will then use the [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) library to plot these links, as well as print some statistics of the resulting graph.
